# seaqt

`seaqt` is a set of `C` bindings for [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) generated by [`seaqt-gen`](https://github.com/seaqt/seaqt-gen), derived from the `C` part of [miqt](https://github.com/mappu/miqt). See `seaqt-gen` for more information.

The bindings are still going through significant changes, including in naming and structure - this repository is a preview intended for feedback.

The code may occasionally be **rebased** before the dust settles on a generally useful initial release.

## Using the bindings

`seaqt` can be used stand-alone or imported into other languages that support calling `C` functions via their [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface).

### Qt versions

Bindings are generated for each Qt release into a separate branch named after the Qt `major.minor` version.

Bindings for a specific minor version can generally be used with all minor Qt versions following it - ie the `6.4` bindings are compatible with `6.5` etc but not with `6.2` and `7.0`. Use the lowest `minor` version that provides the functionality you need, for maximum compatibility!

| Qt Version | Branch |
| ---------- | ------ |
| 5.15+      | https://github.com/seaqt/seaqt/tree/qt-5.15 |
| 6.4+       | https://github.com/seaqt/seaqt/tree/qt-6.4  |

### Finding Qt

Qt gets located using `pkg-config` - use `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to point to a specific Qt installation:

```sh
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/Qt5.2.1/5.2.1/gcc_64/lib/pkgconfig/:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
```
